			<h3> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>	
			
			<p> Amazon is a online retailer that sales a massive amount of products of all varieties such as books, electronics, workout gear, food, etc.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> Constrast: each element of Amazon's homepage is clearly differentiated and properly shaped for visibility </li>
				
				<li> Repetition: Amazon have uniform design across each of its top categories. each section on the homepage is uniform in design and color.    </li>
				
				<li> Alignment: Nothing feels out of place and everything fits nicely on the page  </li>
				
				<li> Proximity: All related elements are place close to one another properly each of the categories are place directly next to each other.  </li>
				
			</ul>

			<h3> <a href="http://durgasoft.com/">Durgasoft</a> </h3>
			
			<p> Durgasoft is a test website showing how bad a website can actually look. Its plasted with ads and terrible formating as a joke and is completely intentional.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> Constrast: while similar elements are same sized the colors of these elements are mixmatched and make the users eyes collide on every element. They should find a color scheme for the website and stick with it.  </li>
				
				<li> Repetition: Durgasoft does repeat similar elements in the middle of the website but the ads on the side are not repeated properly and are missaligned. ads not only should be less intrusive but should repeat in a pattern so the users eye can flow through the page and not get distracted</li>
				
				<li> Alignment: Not only the ads but the sidebar on the right side of the webpage throws off the alignment of every element and make the page asymetric which is unappealing to the eye. The side bar should go more to the side so the elements in the middle can truely be in the middle  </li>
				
				<li> Proximity: Some elements such as the "new online batches" are in close proximity but the ads along the websites frame are massivly seperated and disjointed. They should move some elements closer together and shrink less important elements so everything can fit.  </li>
			</ul>
