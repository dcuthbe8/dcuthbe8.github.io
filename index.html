        <h3>Thoughts on College in general</h3>
        
        <p>
           College to me was more about the experience and less the information . some classes had a varying amounts of work and effort needed to simply pass the test assigned much less absorb the material so 90% of what ive done at college will probably not be retained, however the people and experinces ive had at college will drastically shape me into the man i will be in the future, for better or for worse. So college is definitly important to me.

            "Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions - not outside."
